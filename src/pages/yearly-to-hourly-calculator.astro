      <p><strong>What is $65,000 a year per hour?</strong><br>
      $65,000 annually divided by a full-time schedule (40h/week √ó 52 weeks) is roughly $31.25/hour. Type "65k a year is how much an hour" and use this tool for a tailored result.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I calculate yearly salary to hourly wage?</strong><br>
      Divide your annual salary by total hours worked in a year. For example: $75000 / (40 √ó 52) = $36.06/hour. This tool automates the math instantly.</p>

      <p><strong>Does this include taxes?</strong><br>
      No ‚Äî this is a gross pay calculator. It's for estimating your base hourly pay before tax deductions or bonuses.</p>

      Understanding your true hourly wage helps you compare job offers, negotiate salary, and manage your monthly expenses more effectively.</p>
