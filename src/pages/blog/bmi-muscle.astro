      <h1>Does Muscle Mass Affect BMI?</h1>

      <p>Yes — muscle mass absolutely affects BMI. In fact, it’s one of the biggest reasons why the Body Mass Index can be misleading.</p>

      <h2>Why BMI Increases With Muscle</h2>
      <p>BMI is based purely on your height and weight. It doesn’t account for whether your weight comes from fat or muscle. Since muscle is denser and heavier than fat, people with more muscle mass will weigh more — and therefore have a higher BMI.</p>

      <h2>Example: A Bodybuilder vs. Average Adult</h2>
      <p>A professional athlete who is 5'9" and weighs 210 lbs might have a BMI of 31 — technically obese. But their body fat percentage might be under 10%.</p>

      <p>Compare that to someone with the same height and weight, but a sedentary lifestyle. That person could have 30–40% body fat — a major health concern. Same BMI, very different health profiles.</p>

      <h2>What to Use Instead?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Body Fat Percentage:</strong> This is more accurate for muscular individuals. Tools like DEXA scans or bioimpedance scales can help.</li>
        <li><strong>Waist Circumference:</strong> Fat around the midsection is a better predictor of disease risk than BMI alone.</li>
        <li><strong>Muscle Mass Adjustment:</strong> Use our <a href="/bmi-calculator">BMI calculator</a> with the muscle level feature to get a more realistic result.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who Should Be Cautious With BMI?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Athletes and weightlifters</li>
        <li>People with naturally broad builds</li>
        <li>Anyone who’s gaining muscle during weight loss</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>BMI is a helpful starting point — but it’s not a diagnosis. If you’re muscular, don’t panic over a high number. Use additional tools and measurements to evaluate your true health.</p>
