    <h1>How to Calculate Percentage Change and Growth (With Free Calculator)</h1>
    <p>Percentage change and growth are essential concepts in business, finance, education, and everyday life. Whether you're tracking revenue, test scores, weight, or investments, understanding these values gives you insight into trends and performance. In this article, you'll learn exactly how to calculate percentage change and growth — with formulas, examples, and a free tool to make it easy.</p>

    <h2>🔢 What Is Percentage Change?</h2>
    <p><strong>Percentage change</strong> refers to how much a number increases or decreases relative to its starting value. It's commonly used to measure profit, price increases, grade changes, and more.</p>

    <h3>🧮 Formula:</h3>
    <p><code>Percentage Change = ((New - Old) / Old) × 100</code></p>

    <h3>📘 Example:</h3>
    <p>If your stock was $100 last year and is $120 today, the change is:<br><br>
    ((120 - 100) / 100) × 100 = <strong>20%</strong> increase</p>

    <h2>📈 What Is Percentage Growth?</h2>
    <p><strong>Percentage growth</strong> is similar to percentage change but is typically used when tracking increases over time — like year-over-year revenue, population growth, or fitness goals.</p>

    <p>The formula is the same as percentage increase: ((New - Start) / Start) × 100</p>

    <h3>📘 Example:</h3>
    <p>Your savings grew from $5,000 to $6,500 in 12 months. That's:<br><br>
    ((6500 - 5000) / 5000) × 100 = <strong>30%</strong> growth</p>

    <h2>💡 Why It Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business:</strong> Compare quarterly sales, monitor profit margins</li>
      <li><strong>Health:</strong> Track weight loss/gain percentage</li>
      <li><strong>Education:</strong> Analyze improvement in test scores</li>
      <li><strong>Investing:</strong> Monitor asset appreciation or depreciation</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What is the difference between percent change and percent difference?</strong><br>
    Percent change is directional (increase or decrease). Percent difference compares two values regardless of which is larger.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I use this for money, scores, or grades?</strong><br>
    Yes! Percentage change applies to money, points, scores, or anything measurable.</p>
