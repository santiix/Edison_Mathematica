  <h1>How to Calculate Body Fat Percentage Accurately</h1>

  <p>Understanding your <strong>body fat percentage</strong> is one of the most effective ways to assess your overall fitness and health. Unlike BMI, which only considers height and weight, body fat percentage tells you how much of your body is composed of fat — and that’s a big deal for weight loss, muscle gain, and general wellness.</p>

  <h2>📏 What Is Body Fat Percentage?</h2>
  <p>Body fat percentage is the percentage of your total body weight that comes from fat. It includes essential fat (needed for organs and hormone function) and storage fat (used for energy).</p>

  <h2>💡 Why It’s Better Than BMI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>More specific</strong> – BMI can misclassify muscular people as overweight.</li>
    <li><strong>Tracks fat loss</strong> – The scale might not move, but your fat could drop.</li>
    <li><strong>Better for athletes and lifters</strong> – They may have low body fat but a high BMI.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>⚙️ Most Accurate Ways to Calculate Body Fat</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>DEXA scan</strong> – Highly accurate but expensive.</li>
    <li><strong>Body calipers</strong> – Used by trainers, but requires skill.</li>
    <li><strong>U.S. Navy formula</strong> – Best online method using height, neck, waist, and hips.</li>
  </ul>

    <li><strong>Women:</strong> 18–28% is typical, 14–20% for athletes</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔁 How Often Should You Measure?</h2>
  <p>Check every 2–4 weeks. Take measurements in the morning and under similar conditions to track true progress.</p>
