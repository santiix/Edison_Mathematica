      <h1>What to Do If Your BMI Is 35 or More</h1>

      <p>If your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 35 or higher, it falls into the category of class 2 obesity. This level of BMI can increase the risk of serious health conditions, but the good news is that change is possible — and it starts with small steps.</p>

      <h2>Why BMI Matters</h2>
      <p>BMI is a simple way to estimate whether your body weight is appropriate for your height. While it doesn't account for muscle mass, it's widely used to identify weight-related health risks.</p>

      <h2>Health Risks of a BMI Over 35</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased risk of type 2 diabetes</li>
        <li>High blood pressure and heart disease</li>
        <li>Sleep apnea and breathing problems</li>
        <li>Joint pain and reduced mobility</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practical Steps to Lower Your BMI</h2>
      <p>Here are some healthy, realistic steps you can begin today:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Track your current BMI</strong> using our <a href="/bmi-calculator">free BMI calculator</a></li>
        <li><strong>Set small weight loss goals</strong> — even 5–10% loss can improve health</li>
        <li><strong>Use a <a href="/calorie-deficit-calculator">calorie deficit calculator</a></strong> to plan meals that help reduce body fat</li>
        <li><strong>Walk 20–30 minutes a day</strong> to build consistency</li>
        <li><strong>Eat more whole foods</strong> and reduce sugar and processed snacks</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep 7–8 hours nightly</strong> to support metabolism and hormone balance</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Is BMI Always Accurate?</h2>
      <p>If you have a muscular build or are an athlete, BMI may not reflect your health accurately. Use our <a href="/bmi-calculator">BMI tool</a> with the muscle mass setting for a better result.</p>
