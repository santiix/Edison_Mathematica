      <h2>üìò Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <p><strong>What is a percentage calculator?</strong><br>
      A percentage calculator helps you find the percentage change between two values, whether it's growth, loss, or difference. This tool is essential for analyzing changes in data across finance, health, business, and education.</p>

      <p><strong>How do I calculate percentage increase?</strong><br>
      Use the formula ((New - Old) / Old) √ó 100. Our calculator automates this, helping you quickly compute things like salary increases, grade improvements, or business revenue growth.</p>

      <p><strong>When should I use percentage decrease?</strong><br>
      Use it when tracking losses ‚Äî like stock price drops, weight reduction, or discount pricing. This calculator makes it easy to see the percentage value lost from your starting point.</p>

      <p><strong>What‚Äôs the difference between percent difference and percent change?</strong><br>
      Percent difference compares two values regardless of which came first. Percent change measures directional change (increase or decrease). Use difference when comparing measurements or test scores.</p>

      <p><strong>What is percentage growth and how do I use the chart?</strong><br>
      Percentage growth tracks how much a value has increased over time. Input start/end values and number of days to visualize the change on a timeline chart. Great for savings tracking, weight loss progress, or business KPIs.</p>

      <p><strong>Why is this calculator good for SEO-related keyword queries?</strong><br>
      This tool targets high-volume keywords like "percentage increase calculator," "percentage growth calculator," and "online percentage tool" to help more users find accurate, instant answers to common math problems.</p>
